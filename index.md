We are a member of USA Artistic Swimming and compete in local, regional, and national competitions. We have a history of placing in the top ten at the Age Group National Championship and consistently qualifying for National Competitions. 

Our team strives to promote the values of good sportsmanship, physical and mental health, and a sense of community both within our team and with our local community.

Our goal is to build mentally strong athletes in and out of the pool that continues throughout adulthood. Each athlete will learn and practice artistic swimming skills and routines throughout the season. Learning to maintain a strong commitment to their teammates, personal responsibility and a strong work ethic in an atmosphere of dedication and fun.

5280 Synchro practices from September through May (June for Junior Olympic athletes) in the Boulder, Colorado area located at the base of the Flatirons Mountains.
